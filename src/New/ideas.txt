approach 1: 
    1. frenet with constant velocity assumption for future trajectories
    2. CoRiMa for risk prediction

approach 2:
    1. frenet with IDM for future trajectories 
    2. uncertainity in trajectory using circular size based on speed
    3. compute the area of overlap of 2 circles for each future time steps
    4. if risk value beyond certain value at any time step, alert!

idea for smart overlap:
overlap with 3 circles: big center and 2 at the extremes
