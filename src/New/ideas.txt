approach 1: 
    1. frenet with constant velocity assumption for future trajectories
    2. CoRiMa for risk prediction

approach 2:
    1. frenet with IDM for future trajectories 
    2. uncertainity in trajectory using circular/elliptical size based on speed
    3. compute the area of overlap of 2 circles/elliptical for each future time steps
    4. if risk value beyond certain value at any time step, alert!
